\title{Bootstrapped Ruscio's A with 95 percent CIs and standard error}
\usage{
ruscios_A_boot(
  data,
  variable = "Score",
  group = "Condition",
  value1 = "B",
  value2 = "A",
  B = 1999,
  Conf.Level = 0.95,
  seed = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data}

\item{variable}{continuous variable}

\item{group}{dichotomous group}

\item{value1}{assignment of group 1 (usually B, after intervention)}

\item{value2}{assignment of group 2 (usually A, before intervention)}

\item{B}{Number of boostrapped resamples}

\item{Conf.Level}{1 - alpha value (e.g., .95).}

\item{seed}{seed value for reproducability}

\item{adjust_ceiling}{(currently not in use) Should Ruscio's A estimates of 0 and 1 be adjusted so that they can be converted to finite odds ratios? This is done by rescoring a single data point as being was inferior to a single second data point between the conditions. Ie., it uses the best granularity allowed by the data, as more data points will result in a more extreme possible values of A.}
