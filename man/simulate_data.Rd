\title{Simulate AB SCED data}
\usage{
simulate_data(
  participants = 10,
  timepoints_a = 15,
  timepoints_b = 15,
  cohens_d = 1.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{participants}{number of participants to simulate}

\item{timepoints_a}{number of timepoints to simulate for condition A}

\item{timepoints_b}{number of timepoints to simulate for condition B}

\item{cohens_d}{the true effect size to simulate. Default of Cohen's d = 1.5, which corrisponds to a Ruscio's A of 0.85. NB this is stated in Cohen's d rather than Hedges' g because g is sample size dependent where d is not.}
}
\description{
Simulate data for an AB SCED design using simstudy
An arbitrary number of timepoints can be simulated, and an arbitrary true effect size.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# True effect size of Cohen's d = 1.5 / A = 0.85.
# simulate data using these parameters
sim <- simulate_data(participants = 10, timepoints_a = 15, timepoints_b = 15, cohens_d = 1.5)
}
